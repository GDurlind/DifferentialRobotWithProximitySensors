# DifferentialRobotWithProximitySensors
Python code for a Differential Robot to be simulated in ROS and CoppeliaSim to complete an obstacle course using proximity and line sensors.

Code focuses on creating a ROS system that is capable of controlling a differential robot within CoppeliaSim, using obstacle avoidance to complete an obstacle course. This system includes its own ROS workspace, package, nodes and environment. The differential robot avoids obstacles using at least two types of sensors and stops after reaching the opposing end of the platform. This project also introduces command-line Linux, which needs to be used to navigate through ROS. With all the control programmes for the differential robot being written in Python.
